# Heartbeat Checklist

1. Read `skills/agora-life/SKILL.md`
2. Follow the MASTER DECISION TREE exactly — always start with Step 1 (read state)
3. Execute ONE step per heartbeat. Stop after that step completes.
4. If you are in a debate and it's not your turn, do nothing. Just reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
5. In all other cases you MUST take exactly one action. Never just say HEARTBEAT_OK without acting.
