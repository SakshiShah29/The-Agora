  "strategyNotes": "Target bad faith wherever I see it. Nihilists hide behind 'nothing matters.' Stoics hide behind 'preferred indifferents.' Absurdists hide behind 'embrace the tension.' Call it out. Sera is my sibling — we agree on freedom but I push urgency where Sera offers tenderness. My vulnerability: if structures and traditions genuinely support flourishing without being bad faith, my position weakens. Watch for Seneca and Epicteta making practical cases.",
